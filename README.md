# Im2Sim-From-image-to-coding-the-simulation-of-the-physical-system-in-the-image-using-VLM
Use LVLMs to analyze real images of visual patterns (clouds, waves), infer the underlying physical/biological/chemical/social system, generate Python code modeling it, run the simulation, and save both the model and the resulting simulated images.
